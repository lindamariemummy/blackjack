This game allows the user to play blackjack/21 with the computer. The game uses a single deck of 52 cards, which is shuffled after half the deck has been used.

The objects created are Card, Hand, and Deck. 

Blackjack runs on the console and does not contain a GUI of any kind.

Next on my agenda: add in betting a betting option.
